# Simple Explanation

This simulator computes all possible intersections, then checks which of those possible intersections is soonest to
occur, and checks if it is a real intersection that will happen, if it will, the simulator runs for Δt time, which
is enough for that collision to occur. Once the intersection occurs, the whole process runs again.
The idea is that CUDA allows this to occur very fast, by computing a lot of data in parallel (all segments and
intersections), and is very precise, not losing precision to particles teleporting.

## Collision calculation

### Between particles

Points ≈ $A$, $B$  
Velocities ≈ $A_v$, $B_v$  
Collsion time ≈ $t_I$  
Radius of particle ≈ $\Delta d$  
Distance between particles ≈ $d(X, Y)$  

$A = (A_x, A_y)$   
$B = (B_x, B_y)$  
$Av = (A_{vx}, A_{vy})$  
$Bv = (B_{vx}, B_{vy})$  

$d(A + A_v t_I, B + B_v t_I) = 2 \Delta d$  
$d(A + A_v t_I, B + B_v t_I) = \sqrt{(A_x - B_x)^2 + (A_y - B_y)^2}$  

Then:

$d(A + A_v t, B + B_v t) = [(A_{vx} - B_{vx})^2 + (A_{vy} - B_{xy})^2] t^2 + 2 [(A_x - B_x)(A_{vx} - B_{vx}) + (A_y - B_y)(A_{vy} - B_{vy})] t + (A_x - B_x)^2 + (A_y-B_y)^2 - (2 \Delta d)^2$

Then:

$a = (A_{vx} - B_{vx})^2 + (A_{vy} - B_{xy})^2$  
$b = 2 [(A_x - B_x)(A_{vx} - B_{vx}) + (A_y - B_y)(A_{vy} - B_{vy})]$  
$c = (A_x - B_x)^2 + (A_y - B_y)^2 - (2 \Delta d)^2$  
$d = b^2 + 4 a c$  

And we use:

$$ t_1 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{d}}{2 a} $$

#### Failure cases

* $d < 0$: No intersect  
* $b > -1e-6$: Glancing  
* $b >= 0$: Getting farther  
* $t0 < 0$ and $t1 > 0$ and $b <= -1e-6$: No intersect  

### Between particle and boundary

Point ≈ $A$  
Position (this is the same axis as wall, x for side collision, y for top/bottom) ≈ $A_p$  
Velocity (this is the same axis as wall, x for side collision, y for top/bottom) ≈ $A_v$  
Collision time ≈ $t_I$  
Radius of particle ≈ $\Delta d$   
Wall position (this is the X coordinate for the sides, and Y coordinate for top/bottom) ≈ $wall$   
Distance between particle and wall ≈ $d(X)$  

$d(A + A_v t_I, wall) = \Delta d$  
$d(A + A_v t_I, wall) = \sqrt{(A_p + A_v t_I - wall)^2}$

Then:

$d(A + A_v t_I, wall) = (A_p - wall)^2 - (\Delta d)^2 + 2 (A_p - wall) A_v + A_v^2 t_I^2$

Then:

$a = A_v^2$  
$b = 2 (A_p - wall) A_v$  
$c = (A_p - wall)^2 - (\Delta d)^2 = (A_p - wall + \Delta d) (A_p - wall - \Delta d)$  
$d = b^2 - 4 a c$  

And we use:

$$ t_1 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{d}}{2 a} $$

#### Failure cases

* $d < 0$: No intersect  
* $b > -1e-6$: Glancing  
* $b >= 0$: Getting farther  
* $t0 < 0$ and $t1 > 0$ and $b <= -1e-6$: No intersect


## Position calculation

Particle A position before ≈ $(x, y)$  
Particle A position after ≈ $(x', y')$  
Particle A velocity ≈ $(v_x, v_y)$  
timestep ≈ $\Delta t$  

$$(x', y') = (x + v_x \Delta t, y + v_y \Delta t)$$

## Velocity calculation

Velocity is only updated for colliding particles as there is no acceleration.

### Collision against wall
Particle position ≈ $(x, y)$  
Particle velocity before ≈ $(v_x, v_y)$  
Particle velocity after ≈ $({v'}_x, {v'}_y)$  

#### Vertical wall

$$({v'}_x, {v'}_y) = (-v_x, v_y)$$  

#### Horizontal wall

$$({v'}_x, {v'}_y) = (v_x, -v_y)$$  

### Collision particle

Particle A position ≈ $(A_x, A_y)$  
Particle A velocity before ≈ $(A_{vx}, A_{vy})$  
Particle A velocity after ≈ $(A'_{vx}, A'_{vy})$  
Particle B position ≈ $(B_x, B_y)$  
Particle B velocity before ≈ $(B_{vx}, B_{vy})$  
Particle B velocity after ≈ $(B'_{vx}, B'_{vy})$  


$$({A'}_{vx}, {A'}_{vy}) = \frac{(B_{vx}, B_{vy})}{||(B_{vx}, B_{vy})||} * ||(A_{vx}, A_{vy})|| $$  
$$({B'}_{vx}, {B'}_{vy}) = \frac{(A_{vx}, A_{vy})}{||(A_{vx}, A_{vy})||} * ||(B_{vx}, B_{vy})|| $$

## Implementation details


### Saving collision time data

Particle A ≈ i  
Particle B ≈ j  
Collision time between A and a wall ≈ a  
Collision time between A and B ≈ b  
Data isn't saved because it would be duplicated ≈ x  

                    i
            0   1   2   3   4   5  
        0   a | b | b | b | b | b |
        1   x | a | b | b | b | b |
    j   2   x | x | a | b | b | b |
        3   x | x | x | a | b | b |
        4   x | x | x | x | a | b |
        5   x | x | x | x | x | a |
